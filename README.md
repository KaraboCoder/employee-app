# Employees App

This is a fullstack app for managing employees. It has a backend built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com), the data layer is handled with [Mongoose](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/mongodb) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. The frontend is built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). State management is done with the Context API.


# How to run the app

Start by running the **backend app first**, which will run on port 3000, then run the frontend app and choose any port.
